# My NeoVim config
=====

Warning: This is a NeoVim config only!
Desktop files and config are provided

plugins are not updated using github submodules for the sake of simplicity and
that any service can be temporary. The config might seems too minimal or too 
extensive but this is my own personal one.

If you're reading this on GitHub then it means it's a mirror of my own config
and so it might not be so updated. 
Unix only(who uses NeoVim on windows anyways?)

Desktop files sets terminal to xterm-256color before executing so be sure to
modify the colorscheme(gruvbox) and/or the command if your terminal can't handle
it!
